# RPG Hacker's Public SMW Workspace
My SMW workspace for all of my public stuff. Contributions via pull requests are welcome!

# Setup
For testing convenience, please follow the instructions listed in README.md inside the baserom directory.

For better readibility of Asar code (especially using my rather unique coding style), I recommend downloading Notepad++ and importing the [Asar syntax highlighting extension](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar/blob/master/ext/notepad-plus-plus/syntax-highlighting.xml) from the [official Asar repository](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar) as a user-defined language. This adds some decent syntax highlighting for Asar-compatible ASM code to Notepad++.
